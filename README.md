# -Multi-Cycle-RISC-V-Processor-Core
A synthesizable 32-bit multi-cycle RISC-V processor designed in Verilog. This project implements a core subset of the RV32I instruction set architecture, with a focus on demonstrating a robust control unit and datapath capable of handling data processing, memory access, and control flow instructions.
